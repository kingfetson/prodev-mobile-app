## ðŸ“± First Mobile App with Expo Router

This project sets up a basic mobile app using Expo Router, allowing easy navigation and web/device testing with Expo Go.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

Navigate to Your Project Directory
Open your terminal and move to your parent project directory:

#### cd prodev-mobile-setup

### > Set Up Your Project

Initialize a new Expo project using the latest Expo Router template:

> npx create-expo-app@latest .

### Modify the Home Screen

Open app/(tabs)/index.tsx.
Locate the default text Welcome!.
Change it to ** First App Created**.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

npm run reset-project
Observed Effects:
